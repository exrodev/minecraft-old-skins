# Minecraft Old Skins

## How to use

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Create two folders, one called `skins` and the other called `capes`.

Place your skins/capes in their respective folders and name the files `username.png`, and replace `username` with whatever account you want to have that skin/cape.

Run the script by typing `node index.js`.

[Edit your hosts file](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/modify-your-hosts-file) and add the IP address to the machine running the script.
